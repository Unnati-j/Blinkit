# Blinkit Dashboard

This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance for Blinkit, a last-minute grocery delivery service in India. The dashboard provides key insights into total and average sales, item counts, ratings, and other business metrics. 

Key features of the project include:
- **Sales Analysis**: Total sales ($1.20M), average sales per transaction ($141), and analysis by fat content categories (low fat: $776.32K, regular: $425.36K).
- **Product Performance**: Breakdown of sales by item types, with top-performing categories such as fruits, snacks, and household items.
- **Outlet Insights**: Metrics segmented by tier location (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities), outlet size (medium, small, high), and type (e.g., supermarkets, grocery stores).
- **Trends and Visualization**: Time-series data illustrating sales growth from 2012 to 2022, alongside interactive visuals for outlet location and size contributions.
- **Customer Metrics**: Insights into customer preferences, including average ratings (3.9 stars) and item visibility across different outlet types.

The project utilizes Power BI's data visualization tools to deliver actionable insights, empowering Blinkit's stakeholders to identify trends, optimize operations, and enhance customer satisfaction.
